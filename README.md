3D Multiplayer Parkour Game

a) **Game (Concept, target audience, Genre, look and feel)**

This game is a parkour - platform game that will appeal to anyone from 5 to 65. This game has a fresh look with vibrant colors and cartoon objects and players all around the environment. The time restriction feeling will be very strong while the players try to be the first to reach the finish line. 

b) **Story of the game**

Because this is a parkour game, we want to create our story after the first vertical slice. Firstly we generally worked on the mechanics of the game.

c) **Player** 

There are four players, all of them are human models with different outfits. They are obtained from a free asset in Unity asset store. The website link of assets we used for characters is this: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/survival-stylized-characters-5-weapons-115559
This is the image of the player models we decided to use.
 
As it is apparent in the link and picture above, players are average sized human beings with various outfits. Difference in outfits will help us to differentiate the different players from each other. They are cartoon characters which is also the general art style of our game. The players are now able to move to the front, back, right, left, for the time being. Additionally they have movement animations. They will also be able to jump and climb over objects, and crouch under them. They will be able to run towards any way. When we come to the relationship with other characters, basically they try to pass any other player and try to be the first to reach the finish line. So, players will be able to do anything to slow down, stop or eliminate other players by pushing other players off platforms. Players will be equally fast.

d) **Objectives of the game**

Users will try to get to the finish line as fast as possible. Since the game includes 4 real players, there will be a competition between each player so the most important thing which is finishing each parkour in the first place will be quite remarkable. While parkouring, the user will have 3 rights to fall down. Otherwise, the user will be eliminated from that parkour but will be able to continue racing for the rest of the levels. After the user finishes the first level with the opponents, entire teams who are competing with each other will continue from the 2. Level. When all the levels are completed, points for each player (user) will be calculated and the winner who has the highest score will be labeled as winner.

e) **Economy** 
There will be a rank system that will award the players to reach them on top  of the leader table.

f)  **Environment** 
Each level is in a different setting. The first level that we could complete to design is in a city, more specifically in the street. We wanted to use cartoon art style again, and we found a suitable environment asset package from Unity Asset Store. Our first level is in a city environment. Firstly, we had a green ground that is an asset for grass and we put a road in the centre. Then we started to put various buildings, trees, chairs etc. to decorate the environment. You can see the pictures of the environment below.

We decided to use vibrant colors to make it appealing to play for the players. Our environment is the main object in the game because it is a parkour game.

g) **Start of the game**
At the beginning of the game, there will be a screen which the user will use for joining rooms, settings, etc. After all the 4 players join the room, players will be asked to click “ready” in order to understand whether they are ready for starting a new game or not.

h) **Challenges, missions** 
We have 4 different levels which will look like a desert parkour, city parkour, jungle parkour and lastly a sea view parkour. These levels will have their own challenges and features.(wind, gravity etc.). There are also challenges between players; there are X amount of players (4 or more) in our game and the players will compete simultaneously on the same course. In addition, we will have a timer, which will increase the competition rate. Additionally, players will be able to disrupt each other's positions.

j) **Level Designs** 

For the level design in the previous vertical slice, we had considered building 4 different levels which will look like a desert parkour, city parkour, jungle parkour and lastly a sea view parkour. Each level will have arts depending on its circumstances. In the city parkour, we considered using items that can be seen in real city life easily such as traffic lights, dumpsters, buildings, benches, fire hydrants as seen in images below, different parts of the parkour are also
visible:
